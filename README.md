# Indonesia's Earthquake Activity (tableau)

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the seismic activity in Indonesia from 2008 to 2024. It presents key metrics and visualizations to understand the frequency, intensity, and distribution of earthquakes in the region.

# Key Metrics

Earthquake Count: Indonesia experienced a staggering 92,887 earthquakes during the period from 2008 to 2024.
Average Depth: The average depth of these earthquakes was 49 km.
Average Magnitude: The average magnitude of the earthquakes was 4 on the Richter scale.

# Visualizations

Seismic Activity Map: This map depicts the spatial distribution of earthquakes across Indonesia and its surrounding areas. Each dot represents an earthquake, with colors indicating different magnitude ranges (red for higher magnitudes and orange/yellow for lower magnitudes).
Earthquake Intensity Scatter Plot: This scatter plot shows the relationship between earthquake magnitude and depth. Each point represents an earthquake, with the x-axis indicating the depth and the y-axis representing the magnitude. The scatter plot reveals the clustering of earthquakes at different depth levels and their corresponding magnitudes.
Annual Earthquake Occurrences: This bar chart displays the annual count of earthquakes in the Indonesian archipelago from 2008 to 2023. It provides insights into the yearly trends and fluctuations in seismic activity, allowing for the identification of periods with higher or lower earthquake occurrences.

This dashboard serves as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and the general public interested in understanding Indonesia's seismic activity and its potential impacts. The data and visualizations can be used for further analysis, risk assessment, and disaster preparedness efforts.
